- 👋 Hi, I’m @Palm-s
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a software engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend (JS, React), later on planning on attending a course for fullstack to get a scrape / overview of software development as a whole and after that choose front/backend as primary goal.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to JS/React
- 📫 How to reach me: e-mail me at palm.sgit@gmail.com
